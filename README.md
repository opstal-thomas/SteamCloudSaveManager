# Steam Cloud Save Manager

A simple Unity application that allows you to remove save files from supported steam games.

I will be looking into more functionality in the future but this is all i needed for the time being.


Created because Steam does not have this functionality within steam itself.

Note: Not all steam games use the steam API to manage cloud saves. This application only supports games that use the Cloud Save API that steam provides with it's SDK.

This projected is created using the facepunch.steamworks wrapper.
The wrapper can be found here: https://wiki.facepunch.com/steamworks/
